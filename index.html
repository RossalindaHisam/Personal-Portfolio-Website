    <p class="more-text"> Currently, I am a student at Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin (UniSZA), pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology (Media Informatics). My academic journey began at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Dabong, where I completed my Form Six education with a focus on social sciences. As the fourth child among my siblings, family holds a special place in my heart. I come from the serene village of Kampung Slow Temiang, where the slow pace of life allows me to appreciate the simple joys and beauty of nature.

Wandering is not just a hobby for me; it's a way of life. The excitement of discovering new places and experiencing different cultures is a source of joy and satisfaction for me. Whether navigating through bustling city streets or trekking through remote natural landscapes, the sense of adventure and discovery fuels my spirit.

In addition to my love for wandering, I am deeply immersed in my studies at UniSZA, where I explore the fascinating intersection of technology and media informatics. This academic journey is preparing me for a future where I can contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of information technology.

Alongside my passion for wandering, I also have a deep interest in climbing. Scaling mountains not only presents physical challenges but also offers a profound connection to the raw beauty of nature. The combination of wandering and climbing allows me to embrace a holistic approach to life, where both the thrill of reaching new heights and the serenity of discovering unexplored landscapes contribute to my personal growth and fulfillment.

My wanderlust has taken me to various destinations, allowing me to appreciate the diversity of our world. I find solace in the simplicity of connecting with new environments and meeting people with unique stories to share. The thrill of the unknown and the anticipation of what lies around the next corner are elements that keep my adventurous spirit alive.

Looking ahead, my ambition is to translate my passion for hospitality into reality by opening my own café. I envision creating a warm and welcoming space where people can gather, relax, and savor delicious offerings. The dream of running a café stems from my desire to bring people together and create memorable experiences through the joy of good food and camaraderie. In essence, my life is a blend of academic pursuits, adventurous wanderings, and a heartfelt aspiration to cultivate a sense of community through my future café..</p>
